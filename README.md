## What I learned

It took me a lot longer to finish this challenge because I completely underestimated how much work would go into a theme toggle-switch. Thankfully however, as I choose harder challenges to work on, I force myself to learn and improve my frontend development.

At first, I tried to learn Material UI and Chakra UI, but I felt that although there were pre-built components, it was difficult to fight against the default settings to get the design that I was looking for. I ended up choosing to learn and use Tailwind CSS for this project, and I don't regret anything. I absolutely enjoyed using Tailwind to design this page because I didn't need to think of class names, modifying one element doesn't break everything, and I have the ability to easily and freely customize my React components.

I will continue to learn and use Tailwind in my future challenges.

## Continued development

I'm looking forward to take on a fullstack application challenge, but I feel like I need to practice more with small javascript applications. I felt like this was especially challenging because I didn't know anything about storing data in localStorage or how to build a small toggle switch. I'm looking forward to building more small components that are unexpectedly challenging, as I'm improving myself and growing as a frontend developer.
